	<p>Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Laptop, Desktop, Tablets and Phones).<br>
		All thanks to Bootstrap developers - <em><b><big>Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter</big></b></em>. Then they later  released it for open-source project. Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins. Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs.</p>
