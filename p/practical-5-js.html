	<p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for <em><b>Client-side</b></em> developments as well as <em><b>Server-side</b></em> developments. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.<br>
		It was created in <em><b><big>1995</big></b></em> by <em><b><big>Brendan Eich</big></b></em> while he was an <em><b><big>engineer at Netscape</big></b></em>. It was originally going to be named <em><b>LiveScript</b></em> but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser.</p>
